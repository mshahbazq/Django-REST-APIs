## Audit Logs

The Audit Logs feature provides comprehensive logging and auditing capabilities for tracking requests, responses, status codes, and more within the project. This feature is essential for maintaining accountability, monitoring application behavior, and ensuring compliance with security and regulatory requirements.

### Overview

The Audit Logs feature is implemented using the auditloggs app, which is integrated into the project to capture and record key information about incoming requests and outgoing responses. This information includes:

Request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Request path (e.g., /api/resource)
User information (if authenticated)
Response status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found)
Timestamps for each request
And more as needed for auditing purposes

## How It Works

**Middleware Integration:** The Audit Logs feature is seamlessly integrated into the project using Django middleware. The custom middleware captures request and response data as requests are processed by the application.

**Database Storage:** Captured audit log entries are stored in the project's database. This allows for easy retrieval and analysis of audit data.

**Customization:** The audit logging functionality can be customized to capture additional information specific to your project's auditing needs.

**Viewing Audit Logs**
To view audit logs and gain insights into the project's request and response history, you can access the logs through the Django admin interface or by implementing custom views and endpoints within your application.

**Security and Compliance**
The Audit Logs feature plays a crucial role in maintaining security and compliance within your project. It helps you track and analyze actions performed by users and system components, aiding in the identification of potential security issues or unauthorized access.
